Time Lock Wallet Smart Contract
Overview
The Time Lock Wallet smart contract is a Solidity-based contract that allows users to deposit funds into a wallet with a predefined unlock time. The contract provides the following key features:

Owner and Beneficiary: The contract has an owner who can update the beneficiary, and a beneficiary who can withdraw the funds after the lock period expires.
Deposit: Users can deposit funds into the contract using the receive() function.
Withdrawal: The beneficiary can withdraw the funds after the lock period expires.
Lock Period Update: The owner can update the beneficiary address.

Contract Structure

owner: The address of the contract owner who can update the beneficiary.
beneficiary: The address of the beneficiary who can withdraw the funds after the lock period expires.
unlockTime: The timestamp when the funds can be withdrawn.
lockperiod: The duration of the lock period, set during contract deployment.
receive(): Allows users to deposit funds into the contract.
withdraw(): Allows the beneficiary to withdraw the funds after the lock period expires.
updateBeneficiary(): Allows the owner to update the beneficiary address.

Usage

Deploy the Time Lock Wallet contract to the Ethereum network, passing the beneficiary address and the lock period (in seconds) as constructor parameters.
Users can deposit funds into the contract using the receive() function.
After the lock period expires, the beneficiary can call the withdraw() function to withdraw the funds.
The owner can call the updateBeneficiary() function to update the beneficiary address.

Security Considerations

Access Control: The contract owner has the ability to update the beneficiary address. Ensure that the owner's address is secure and not susceptible to unauthorized access.
Timestamp Dependency: The contract relies on the block.timestamp variable to determine the unlock time. Be aware of potential timestamp manipulation attacks.
Reentrancy Attacks: The contract does not currently implement any explicit reentrancy protection. Consider using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or the OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard modifier to mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities.
Overflow/Underflow Checks: The contract does not currently implement explicit overflow/underflow checks. Consider using a library like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to prevent arithmetic-related vulnerabilities.

Events

deposited: Emitted whenever funds are deposited into the contract.
withdrawn: Emitted whenever funds are withdrawn from the contract.
